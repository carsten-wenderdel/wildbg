# wildbg

`wildbg` is a backgammon engine based on neural networks. Currently, it's in alpha stage.

## Try it out

#### Online

You can access the API and see yourself how `wildbg` would move: https://wildbg.shuttleapp.rs/swagger-ui/

An example for the starting position and rolling 3 and 1: https://wildbg.shuttleapp.rs/move?die1=3&die2=1&p24=2&p19=-5&p17=-3&p13=5&p12=-5&p8=3&p6=5&p1=-2

#### Locally

Install Rust on your machine and then execute `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`.
A web server will be started which you can access via http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

Beware that the network committed to this repository is a bit older and weaker.

## Goals

1. Provide source code and documentation to train neural nets from zero to super human strength.
2. Implement logic to evaluate all kind of backgammon positions: cubeless and cubeful equities, multi-ply evaluation, rollouts, etc.
3. Make the backgammon engine accessible via an easy-to-use HTTP JSON API.

A graphical user interface (GUI) is not part of this project.

## Training process

The training process consists of three steps, which are repeated in a loop:
1. Find lots of positions (at least 100,000) through self-play for a later rollout.
2. Roll out these positions. Currently, only 1-ply rollouts are possible.
3. Train neural networks based on the rollout data. Currently, a single net with several hidden layers is supported; later different nets for different game phases are planned. This third step is the only one done in Python, everything else is implemented in Rust.

## Contributing

Help is more than welcome! There are some smaller tasks but also bigger ones, see https://github.com/carsten-wenderdel/wildbg/issues.
Currently, most needed is:
- Documentation of backgammon metrics / neural net inputs: https://github.com/carsten-wenderdel/wildbg/issues/4
- Proper cube handling: https://github.com/carsten-wenderdel/wildbg/issues/17
